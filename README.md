# UnityFreeCam
A free moving camera system for Unity. Smoooooth camera movements!

Simply drop in the prefab in the "Extras" folder and hit play. Or check out the example scene! The inspector for the FreeCam script contains tooltips, so you can read those to figure out how to configure the camera, though the default configuration should suit most projects.

[Visit the 'Releases' page](https://github.com/prodigga/UnityFreeCam/releases) to download the latest FreeCam UnityPackage! If you'd like to try it out, just dump it into your project and check out the example scene. Everything is contained in its of folder.
